Because this is app intended to be used to keep a record an Business's inventory , I opted to adapt the login process to stength my app's security. While multiple users are able to create User instances, the placebo validator will only allow employy initials to vary; a user will have to enter the password (labeled as access_id) and the store code to gain access to the app. Also, an email or text confirmation will be sent to User.first every time a person logs in. The form to persit notes from each interaction  which will be a step required to log out will require an employee's initials (employeeInIt) to distinguish between interactions.
